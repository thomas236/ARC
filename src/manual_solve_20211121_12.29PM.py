### YOUR CODE HERE: write at least three functions which solve
### specific tasks by transforming the input x and returning the
### result. Name them according to the task ID as in the three
### examples below. Delete the three examples. The tasks you choose
### must be in the data/training directory, not data/evaluation.

    A dictionary is creacted to keep track of color codes in reverse order.
    that are present after a sepecific color. For this step, color code
    '0' is ignored.
    The 2D array is scanned from right to left and top to bottom. If color
    code '0' is found, that value is replaced by value in the dictionary
    (discussed above) to fill in the specific location in the 2D array.
    To genralise this apprach, another dictionary is alse created to keep
    track of color codes before a specific color.
    Similar to approach above, the 2D array is scanned from left to right 
    and top to bottom are filled when '0' is found. This generalisation step
    takes care of edge cases where '0' is found in left and right most columns.
    
    This 2D array is the solution and is returned.
    Parameters:
    x: 2D Numpy integer array, a single grid containing color codes
